## Utils

This folder contains various scripts to let you perform 
functions on your tor instance. Many of these are from the
[Stem Website](https://stem.torproject.org) which has 
additional documentation on functions you can perform.

Other examples:

Use tor-prompt to interact with a docker process:

```tor-prompt -i 172.16.0.3:9051``
